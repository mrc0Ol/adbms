Q3. Create a table tax details with attributes dept_no, name, tax_amt, state with three partitions p1,
p2 and p3 using the partition attribute tax_amt(range partition) partition p1 for tax <5000, partition
p2 for tax < 10000, p3 for tax <20000.

CREATE TABLE TAX_DETAILS
(
DEPT_NO NUMBER,
NAME VARCHAR(20),
TAX_AMT NUMBER(10),
STATE VARCHAR(15)
)
PARTITION BY RANGE(TAX_AMT)
(
PARTITION P1 VALUES LESS THAN(5000),
PARTITION P2 VALUES LESS THAN(10000),
PARTITION P3 VALUES LESS THAN(20000)
);
INSERT INTO TAX_DETAILS VALUES(32,'IT',17000,'MAHARASHTRA');
INSERT INTO TAX_DETAILS VALUES(21,'SALES',3700,'GUJRAT');
INSERT INTO TAX_DETAILS VALUES(13,'ACCOUNTING',12000,'KERELA');
INSERT INTO TAX_DETAILS VALUES(39, 'RD',7800,'DELHI');
INSERT INTO TAX_DETAILS VALUES(20,'HR',1090,'ASSAM');

1. Display the partition wise data.
Data from partition p1
SELECT * FROM TAX_DETAILS PARTITION (P1);

Data from partition p2
SELECT * FROM TAX_DETAILS PARTITION (P2);

Data from partition p3
SELECT * FROM TAX_DETAILS PARTITION (P3);

2. Display the details if the tax amount is greater than 1000.
SELECT * FROM TAX_DETAILS WHERE TAX_AMT>1000;

3. Display the department having maximum tax amount.
SELECT NAME FROM TAX_DETAILS WHERE TAX_AMT=(SELECT MAX(TAX_AMT)FROM TAX_DETAILS);

4. Display the state and department having minimum tax amount.
SELECT STATE,NAME FROM TAX_DETAILS WHERE TAX_AMT=(SELECT MIN(TAX_AMT)FROM TAX_DETAILS);

5. Drop existing partition p3.
ALTER TABLE TAX_DETAILS DROP PARTITION P3;
SELECT PARTITION_NAME FROM USER_TAB_PARTITIONS WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'TAX_DETAILS';

6. Create a new partition p4 to store all the values greater than 10000.
ALTER TABLE TAX_DETAILS ADD PARTITION P4 VALUES LESS THAN(MAXVALUE);
SELECT PARTITION_NAME FROM USER_TAB_PARTITIONS WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'TAX_DETAILS';

7. Split the partition p2 to s1 and s2 at 8000.
ALTER TABLE TAX_DETAILS SPLIT PARTITION P2 AT(8000) INTO (PARTITION S1,PARTITION S2);

8. Merge the partitions p1 and s1 into p11.
ALTER TABLE TAX_DETAILS MERGE PARTITIONS P1,S1 INTO PARTITION P11;

9.Rename the partition p11 to p1_new.
ALTER TABLE TAX_DETAILS RENAME PARTITION P11 TO P1_NEW;
