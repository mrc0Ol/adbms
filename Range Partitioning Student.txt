Q1. Create table student with attributes stud_id, name, marks with range partitioning and the partitioning
attribute is marks.

CREATE TABLE STUDENT
(
STUD_ID NUMBER,
NAME VARCHAR(25),
MARKS NUMBER
)
PARTITION BY RANGE(MARKS)
(
PARTITION FAIL VALUES LESS THAN(40),
PARTITION SECOND_CLASS VALUES LESS THAN(60),
PARTITION FIRST_CLASS VALUES LESS THAN(75),
PARTITION DIST_CLASS VALUES LESS THAN(100)
);
INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES(32,'SAINATH',96);
INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES(25,’ROHIT',75);
INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES(6,'PRATHAM',60);
INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES(47,'VIVEK',80);
INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES(30,'ADITYA',50);

1. Display contents of the table.
SELECT * FROM STUDENT;

2. Display the details of the students who failed.
SELECT * FROM STUDENT PARTITION(FAIL);

3. Display the details of the students of “second class”.
SELECT * FROM STUDENT PARTITION(SECOND_CLASS);

4. Display the details of the students of “First class”.
SELECT * FROM STUDENT PARTITION(FIRST_CLASS);

5. Display the name of partitions.
SELECT PARTITION_NAME FROM USER_TAB_PARTITIONS WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'STUDENT';

6. Display the details of students who passed with distinctions.
SELECT * FROM STUDENT PARTITION(DIST_CLASS);

7. Display the number of students who failed.
SELECT COUNT(STUD_ID)FROM STUDENT PARTITION(FAIL);

8.Display the details of the student who scored highest marks.
SELECT * FROM STUDENT WHERE MARKS=(SELECT MAX(MARKS) FROM STUDENT PARTITION (DIST_CLASS));

9. Split the partition fail to f1 with marks less than 30 and f2 to marks less than 45.
ALTER TABLE STUDENT SPLIT PARTITION FAIL AT(30) INTO (PARTITION F1,PARTITION F2);
SELECT PARTITION_NAME FROM USER_TAB_PARTITIONS WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'STUDENT';

10. Merge f1, f2 into a new partition pp1;
ALTER TABLE STUDENT MERGE PARTITIONS F1,F2 INTO PARTITION PP1;

12. Add a partition p_new for storing the marks less than 100.
ALTER TABLE STUDENT ADD PARTITION P_NEW VALUES LESS THAN(100);
